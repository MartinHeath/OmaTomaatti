# OmaTomaatti

OmaTomaatti is a simle android application developed using [Android Studio]. It functions as a notepad of sorts, into which you can save your friendsÂ´ bank account numbers.

The application in itself is a work in progress and served as a learning project for myself, as this was my very first android project.

The logic of the program is not *that* complicated. The user can do the following:

* Enter the name of a friend an account and an account number.
* Check the account numbers of entered friends.
* Delete numbers
* Modify account information




### Version
0.0.1  
* The only available language is Finnish
* As I have little knowledge on threads and have limited time, the app is *SLOOOOOW*
* Entries can be modified by settin the person name as an existing name.
* Additional accounts can be added in this same way.
* API support: 14+. Designed and tested with an API 23 emulated android.

### Installation

I have little experience on how one should install this app. It has not been "published", so I suppose you just build and use the app like you would any other android project. If I am missing files or something else, please let me know.

### Todos

 - Write Tests
 - Threads
 - Add *Delete Account* button
 - clean up and refactor code
